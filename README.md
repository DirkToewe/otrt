This project is an exploration of the Sparse Voxel Octree Raytracing/-casting.
It was inspired by the research of Sparse Voxel OctTrees done by IdSoftware for
the IdTech engine as presented during Siggraph 2008.

An in-browser live rendering of the [Stanford Bunny](http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/voldata/voldata.html#bunny)
can be found [here](https://dirktoewe.github.io/otrt/bunny360.html). Give the
`.html`-file a little time to load as it contains roughly 5.5&nbsp;MB of voxel data.
